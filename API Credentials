AMP APIs: Authentication

There are two ways to authenticate when using the Cisco AMP for Endpoints APIs. First, you need to get a client ID from the Cisco AMP console. Once you have the client ID, you can authenticate using one of these methods:

URL authentication: Use this format:
https://<your_client_id>:<your_api_key>@<api_endpoint>

Basic HTTP authentication (Base64): Use this method to encode your client ID and API key in Base64.

To start using the API, follow these simple steps:

Go to the Accounts menu and choose API Credentials.
Click + New API Credentials.
Enter a unique name for your application.
Select the access level: Read-only or Read & Write.
Click Create.
Copy the API Client ID and API Key, and keep them for your API calls.
